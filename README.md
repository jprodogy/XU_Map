# XuMap

XuMap is a navigation service that makes it easier for visitors to navigate XULA’s campus. The current on-campus signage can be more user-friend but this mapping app will fill that need. Users of this app will have many different ways to select a starting location and the app will display the navigation to their ending location. You’ll learn lots about representing data using a graph, ways to use a Map API, and shortest path algorithms.
